# Trip Planner Overview

The trip planner is the main workspace for building your itinerary. It opens automatically after you create a trip, or any time you click a trip card on the dashboard.

## Layout

The planner uses a **three-pane resizable layout** on desktop:

```
┌─────────────────┬──────────────────────────┬──────────────────┐
│  Day Plan       │                          │  Places          │
│  Sidebar        │       Interactive        │  Sidebar         │
│  (left)         │          Map             │  (right)         │
│                 │        (center)          │                  │
└─────────────────┴──────────────────────────┴──────────────────┘
```

- **Left sidebar** — Day plan: your list of days, assigned places, notes, and transport entries. Collapsible via the panel toggle button.
- **Center** — Interactive map showing all place markers and day routes.
- **Right sidebar** — Places list: search, category filters, and bulk actions. Collapsible.

Each sidebar has a drag handle on its inner edge for resizing.

A **Day Detail overlay** slides in over the center pane when you open a specific day, showing weather, the day's notes, reservation summaries, and the accommodation block. It can be minimized without closing it.

## Tabs

The tab bar sits directly below the main navigation bar.

| Tab | Description |
|---|---|
| **Plan** | The three-pane map view described above. Always visible. |
| **Transports** | Flights, trains, cars, cruises, and buses. |
| **Reservations** | Hotels, restaurants, events, tours, and other bookings. |
| **Lists** | Packing list and to-do list. |
| **Costs** | Expense tracking, splitting, and settlement. |
| **Files** | Document manager for receipts, tickets, and other files. |
| **Collab** | Real-time chat, shared notes, and polls. |

> **Admin:** The **Lists**, **Costs**, **Files**, and **Collab** tabs only appear when the corresponding addon is enabled. See [Admin-Addons](Admin-Addons).

The active tab is saved in `sessionStorage` per trip, so switching between trips preserves your last position.

## Mobile Layout

On screens narrower than 768 px, the two sidebars are not shown side-by-side. Instead, two floating buttons appear over the map:

- **Plan** — opens the Day Plan Sidebar as a full-screen overlay.
- **Places** — opens the Places Sidebar as a full-screen overlay.

Tap outside the overlay or use the close button to return to the map.

## Undo

The planner tracks your recent actions — adding places, assigning them to days, reordering, and removing assignments — in a short undo ring. The **Undo** button appears in the Day Plan Sidebar toolbar (at the top of the sidebar) whenever an undoable action is available. It shows the name of the last action as a tooltip on hover and reverses it when clicked.

## Splash Screen

When you first open a trip, a brief loading screen appears while the planner data and place photos are fetched. This screen shows the trip title and a loading animation. Once data is ready and a short grace period for photos has elapsed, the planner workspace appears.
