## Features

### Planning
- **Drag & Drop Planner** — organize places into day plans with reordering and cross-day moves
- **Interactive Map** — Leaflet map with photo markers, clustering, route visualization, and customizable tile sources
- **Place Search** — Google Places (photos, ratings, hours) or OpenStreetMap (free, no API key needed)
- **Day Notes** — timestamped, icon-tagged notes per day
- **Route Optimization** — auto-optimize place order and export to Google Maps
- **Weather Forecasts** — 16-day forecasts via Open-Meteo (no API key required), historical climate averages as fallback

### Travel Management
- **Reservations & Bookings** — track flights, accommodations, restaurants with confirmation numbers and file attachments
- **Budget Tracking** — category-based expenses with pie chart, per-person/per-day splitting, multi-currency support (see [Currencies](Currencies))
- **Packing Lists** — category-based checklists with user assignment, templates, and progress tracking
- **Document Manager** — attach documents, tickets, and PDFs to trips, places, or reservations (up to 50 MB per file)
- **PDF Export** — export complete trip plans as PDF with cover page, images, and notes

### Collaboration
- **Real-Time Sync** — WebSocket-based live sync; changes appear instantly for all connected users
- **Multi-User** — invite members with role-based access
- **Invite Links** — one-time registration links with configurable max uses and expiry
- **OIDC SSO** — sign in with Google, Apple, Authentik, Keycloak, or any OIDC provider
- **Two-Factor Authentication** — TOTP-based 2FA with QR code setup
- **Public Share Links** — share a read-only view of any trip

### Addons _(admin-toggleable)_
- **Lists** — packing lists and to-dos with templates, member assignments, optional bag tracking
- **Budget Planner** — expense tracker with category breakdown, splits, multi-currency
- **Documents** — file manager for trips, places, and reservations
- **Collab** — group chat, shared notes, polls, day-by-day attendance
- **Vacay** — personal vacation day planner with calendar view, public holidays, and carry-over tracking
- **Atlas** — interactive world map, bucket list, travel stats, continent breakdown
- **Journey** — magazine-style travel journal with entries, photos (via Immich/Synology Photos), maps, and moods
- **Naver List Import** — import places from shared Naver Maps lists
- **MCP** — expose TREK to AI assistants via the Model Context Protocol (OAuth 2.1)

> Dashboard widgets (currency converter and timezone clock) are per-user preferences, not an admin-toggleable addon — see [Dashboard-Widgets](Dashboard-Widgets).

### AI / MCP Integration
- **MCP Server** — built-in Model Context Protocol server with OAuth 2.1 authentication
- **150+ Tools** — create trips, plan itineraries, manage budgets, send messages, and more
- **30 Resources** — read-only `trek://` URIs for trips, days, places, budget, packing, journeys, and more
- **27 OAuth Scopes** — granular permissions across 13 permission groups
- **Pre-built Prompts** — `trip-summary`, `packing-list`, and `budget-overview` context loaders

### Admin
- User management, invite links, packing templates, global categories
- Addon management, API key storage, scheduled auto-backups
- System notices for onboarding and announcements

> **Admin:** Most configuration lives in the Admin Panel. On first boot TREK seeds an admin account automatically — credentials come from `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` if set, otherwise a random password is printed to the container log.
