# Public Share Links

Share a read-only view of your trip with people who do not have a TREK account. The viewer opens in a browser without logging in.

## Creating a share link

Open your trip and click the **Share** button (Users icon) in the top navbar. This opens the Members & Share modal. The share link section appears on the right side of the modal and is visible only to users with the `share_manage` permission (trip owner and admins by default).

Click **Create link** to generate a token.

The share URL takes the form:

```
<your-instance>/shared/<token>
```

Copy this URL and send it to anyone you want to share the trip with. No TREK account is required to view it.

## Permission toggles

When creating or updating a share link you choose what the recipient can see. The available flags are:

| Toggle | Default | What it shows |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Map** | Always on | The Plan tab with the interactive map and day-by-day itinerary. This toggle is locked on and cannot be disabled from the UI. |
| **Bookings** (`share_bookings`) | **On** | The Bookings tab with reservations and transport. Also controls whether transport items appear inline in the day plan. |
| **Packing** (`share_packing`) | Off | The packing list tab, grouped by category |
| **Budget** (`share_budget`) | Off | The Budget tab with a total summary and line items grouped by category |
| **Collab** (`share_collab`) | Off | A read-only Chat tab showing messages in chronological order |

Disabled toggles hide the corresponding tab from the public viewer entirely. Permission changes take effect immediately — you do not need to recreate the link.

### Which currency guests see

A public viewer has no account, so there is no "their" display currency to use. The Budget tab is rendered in **the sharer's display currency, falling back to the trip's own currency** — in other words, a guest sees the money the way the person who shared the trip sees it. If the sharer leaves their display currency on **Trip currency** (the default), guests read the trip in the trip's own currency. See [Currencies](Currencies).

## What the public viewer shows

The shared trip page renders a branded read-only interface with a dark hero header showing the trip title, description, and date range. A tab bar at the top provides access to the sections you enabled. The viewer can switch the display language using a language picker in the top-right corner.

The Plan tab is always available and shows an interactive map, a collapsible day-by-day itinerary (with places, notes, and transport inline when Bookings is enabled), and accommodation badges per day.

The Collab tab (when enabled via `share_collab`) shows chat messages grouped by date with sender avatars. Viewers cannot send messages.

## Revoking a share link

Open the Share button in the navbar, then click **Delete link** in the share link section. The existing URL stops working immediately for anyone who has it.

## Journey public share

The Travel Journal (Journey addon) has a separate share mechanism with its own token namespace and permission flags (timeline, gallery, map). See [Journey-Journal](Journey-Journal) for details.
