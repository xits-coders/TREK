# My Trips Dashboard

The dashboard at `/dashboard` is your home base — it lists all your trips, lets you create new ones, and surfaces quick-access widgets.

## View Modes

Use the toggle button in the top toolbar to switch between **grid** (card thumbnails) and **list** (compact rows). Your preference is saved in `localStorage` under the key `trek_dashboard_view` and persists across sessions.

In grid mode the dashboard shows a large [Spotlight card](#spotlight-card) for your most relevant trip, with remaining trips in a responsive grid below. In list mode the Spotlight card is not shown separately — all trips (including the one that would be the spotlight) appear as uniform rows in the same sort order.

## Sort Order

Trips are always sorted in this order:

1. **Ongoing** — trips where today falls between the start and end date.
2. **Upcoming** — future trips, sorted by start date ascending (soonest first).
3. **Past** — completed trips, sorted by start date descending (most recent first).

Trips without dates are treated as past.

## Spotlight Card

The first ongoing trip — or the next upcoming trip if none is ongoing — is promoted to a full-width **Spotlight card** at the top of the grid on desktop. On mobile this card appears as a hero at the top of the page. The spotlight card shows a progress bar for ongoing trips and a stats strip (days, places, travel companions).

If you have no trips yet, the spotlight card is not shown.

## Archived Trips

Archived trips are hidden from the main list and collapsed into a separate **Archived** section at the bottom of the page. Click the section header to expand it. You can **Copy**, **Restore**, or permanently **Delete** an archived trip from the row actions.

## Greeting (Mobile)

On mobile, the header shows a time-of-day greeting — "Good morning", "Good afternoon", or "Good evening" — along with your username and avatar. The greeting changes at 12:00 (noon) and 18:00. The mobile header also includes a **Notifications** button (bell icon) that navigates to `/notifications`.

## Dashboard Widgets Sidebar

On wide screens a sticky right column shows the **Currency Converter** and **Timezone Clock** widgets. Each can be toggled on or off via the Settings icon in the toolbar. On mobile, the widgets are available as a bottom sheet from the quick-action buttons at the top of the page.

See [Dashboard-Widgets](Dashboard-Widgets) for full usage details.

## Per-Trip Actions

On desktop, hover over a card (or open the row actions in list view) to reveal the action buttons — they appear on mouse-over only. On mobile, action buttons are always visible directly on the card cover. The available actions are:

| Action | Permission required |
|---|---|
| **Edit** | `trip_edit` or `trip_cover_upload` on that trip |
| **Copy** | `trip_create` |
| **Archive / Unarchive** | `trip_archive` on that trip |
| **Delete** | `trip_delete` on that trip |

Actions not permitted for your role are hidden. Admins always see all actions.

## Empty State

When you have no trips, the dashboard shows an illustration and a **Plan your first trip** button that opens the [Creating-a-Trip](Creating-a-Trip) dialog.
