# PDF Export

TREK can generate two kinds of PDFs from your trip data: a structured **Trip Plan PDF** and a photo-book-style **Journey Book PDF**. Both render as HTML in a sandboxed iframe and open the browser's native print/save dialog — no server-side processing is involved.

## Trip Plan PDF

### How to generate

Open the Day Plan sidebar in the trip planner. Click the **PDF** button in the toolbar at the top of the sidebar. A preview modal opens immediately; click **Save as PDF** to open your browser's print dialog and save the file.

### Cover page

- Blurred cover image as background (if the trip has one), with the same image in a circular badge
- Trip title and description
- Date range (first day to last day)
- Stat tiles:
  - **Days** — total number of days in the trip
  - **Places** — total places in your trip's place list
  - **Planned** — number of unique places assigned to at least one day
  - **Estimated cost** — sum of all assigned place prices, shown in the trip's currency (hidden if zero)

### Per-day pages

Each day starts on a new page with a dark header bar showing the day number, day title, date, and the day's estimated cost.

Below the header:

- **Accommodation block** (if an accommodation covers that day): action label (Check-in on the first day, Check-out on the last day, or Accommodation for intermediate days), time, place name, address, notes, and confirmation code (only shown on the check-in day)
- **Timeline items** sorted by their order in the day plan:
  - **Places** — thumbnail (or a colored category icon if no image is available), numbered badge, name, category label, address, description, time, price, and notes
  - **Notes** — icon, text, and optional time
  - **Reservations** — type icon, title, time, type-specific metadata (e.g. airline + flight number + route for flights; train number + platform + seat for trains; party size for restaurants; venue for events; operator for tours), location, and confirmation code

### Footer

Every printed page carries a small "made with TREK" logo at the bottom.

### Font

Poppins, loaded from Google Fonts at render time.

### Plugin sections

Installed plugins can append their own sections to the Trip Plan PDF via the `pdfSectionProvider` hook. A plugin returns plain text — a title, paragraphs, and an optional simple table (headers plus rows) — and TREK escapes and lays it out itself. Sections are text-only and additive: a plugin never renders into the document, and one that errors or is slow contributes nothing.

> **Plugins:** requires the `hook:pdf-section-provider` permission. See [Plugin-Development](Plugin-Development) for the hook contract.

## Journey Book PDF

### How to generate

Open a Journey entry in the Travel Journal. Click the **download icon** button in the journal's header area. A preview modal opens; click **Save as PDF** to print.

### Format

A4 landscape (`@page { size: A4 landscape; margin: 0 }`). Font: Inter, loaded from Google Fonts.

### Cover page

- Hero image (journey cover image, or the first entry photo if none is set)
- Journey title and optional subtitle
- Stat tiles: Days, Entries, Photos

### Entry pages

One page per journal entry, in chronological order. The first entry of each date carries a day header (day number and full date) above the content.

Photo layout adapts to the number of photos on the entry:

| Photos | Layout |
|--------|--------|
| 1 | Single image, full width |
| 2 | Two images side by side |
| 3 or more | Large hero image on the left, two stacked images on the right |

Below the photos: entry time and location, entry title, journal text (rendered from Markdown), and pros/cons verdict cards if present.

### Closing page

A dark "The End" card.

## How rendering works

Both PDFs use the same mechanism: the HTML document is written into a sandboxed `<iframe>` via `srcdoc`, and `iframe.contentWindow.print()` opens the browser's print dialog. There is no server-side PDF generation. The file is saved through the browser's built-in "Save as PDF" print destination.
