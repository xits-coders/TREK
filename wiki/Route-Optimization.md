# Route Optimization

TREK calculates walking and driving times between your places and can reorder them to minimize total travel distance.

## Route calculation

TREK uses **OSRM** (Open Source Routing Machine) to calculate routes between consecutive places in the selected day. No API key is required.

Segment time pills always show both a **driving** time (fetched from OSRM using the driving profile) and a **walking** time (estimated at 5 km/h from the OSRM driving distance). There is no user-selectable routing profile — the driving profile is used for all OSRM requests.

Route segments reset at any transport reservation (flight, train, car, bus, or cruise) between two places — that leg is not driven or walked, so no ground route is drawn across it.

## Route display

- Colored line segments connect consecutive places on the map.
- At zoom level 12 or higher, time pills show the estimated walking and driving time between each pair of consecutive places.
- When at least two places are on the selected day, total distance and duration are shown in the sidebar footer.

## Optimize route

The **Optimize** button in the sidebar footer reorders places in the current day to minimize total travel distance using a **nearest-neighbor algorithm**. It starts from the first place, then repeatedly visits the closest unvisited place by straight-line (Euclidean) distance.

Only unlocked places are reordered — locked places stay in their current positions.

The reorder can be undone immediately using the undo action that appears after it is applied.

## Export day to Google Maps

The **Open in Google Maps** button (icon next to Optimize) generates a `https://www.google.com/maps/dir/lat,lng/lat,lng/…` URL containing all places in order and opens it in a new tab.
