# MCP Tools and Resources

TREK exposes **tools** (read and write actions) and **resources** (read-only `trek://` URIs). Tools are registered per-session based on OAuth scopes and enabled addons.

For addon-gated tools (Packing, To-Dos, Atlas, Collab, Vacay, Journey) and their resources, see [MCP-Addon-Tools](MCP-Addon-Tools).

## Tools

### Trip Summary

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `get_trip_summary` | Full denormalized snapshot of a trip — metadata, members, days with assignments and notes, accommodations, budget, packing, reservations, collab notes, and to-dos in one call. Use this as your context loader before making changes. |

### Compound tools

Compound tools collapse multi-step workflows into a single atomic transaction. If the second step fails, the first is rolled back.

> Use compound tools only when the place or item does not yet exist. For existing records, call the individual tools directly.

| `create_place_accommodation` | `create_place` + `create_accommodation` | Create a place and book it as an accommodation. Returns `{ place, accommodation }`. Requires `trips:write`. |
| `create_budget_item_with_members` | `create_budget_item` + `set_budget_item_members` | Create a budget item and set splitting members. If `userIds` is omitted, behaves like `create_budget_item`. Returns `{ item }`. Requires `budget:write`. |
